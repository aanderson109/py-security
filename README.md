## TCP Port Scanner
### Overview
Quick port scanner that reaches out to the user-input host and scans any ports the user specified.
### Current Status & Roadmap
It features a colorful CLI that uses argparse, pyfiglet, and termcolor to be more engaging than a basic command line. It only identifies if it was able to make a connection to the port at the moment. In the immediate future, I'll be adding some more features:
* Fingerprinting services and operating systems
* Traceroute functionality
* Ping functionality (w/o the port scans)

I have more idea for the long-term but I'll save those for later.
